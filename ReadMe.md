# Mapty Project

- This is a project I made during study in Javascript course on Udemy.

### Features

- Help you to log all your workouts (including type, distance, duration, ...) in the map. Because this is just the front end project so all the data will be stored on your local storage.

### Technology

- HTML, CSS, Javascript, display map using _Leaflet_ library.
